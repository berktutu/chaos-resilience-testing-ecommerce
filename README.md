# Chaos & Resilience Testing – E-Commerce

## Project Goal

This project is a small microservice-based e-commerce demo built to showcase chaos and resilience testing. Instead of only testing happy paths, the goal here is to see how the system behaves when things break.

The main objectives are to:

- Use **Playwright** to test the system behaviour from the point of the user
- Observe system behaviour
- Build a very simple microservice-style system
- Simulate failures like: service down, slow responses etc.
- Run everything with Docker

## Why This Project Was Chosen

Lots of junior testers showcase only:

- UI automation or API testing with heavy tool dependence.

**Chaos & Resilience Testing – E-Commerce** project focuses on things like:

- Resilience & reliability
- System quality
- Failure reactions and behaviour
- Clear scope and focus

It's a **portfolio project** to demonstrate deeper QA thought process and interest.

## Initially Planned Tech Stack

- Node.js + Express (for simple services)
- Docker & Docker Compose (to run services)
- Playwright (TypeScript) for end-to-end tests

This project is being built step by step while learning Docker and resilience concepts more in depth.
